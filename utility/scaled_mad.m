% scaled_mad.m
%
% Computes the Scaled-MAD of a dataset A as
%   Scaled-MAD = c*median(A - median(A))
% Where the scaling factor is an optional input.
%
% Inputs:
%   A: The dataset on which to compute the Scaled-MAD. [N x 1 Double]
%   c: The scaling factor. [Optional] (Default ~= 1.4826)
%
% Outputs:
%   sm: The Scaled-MAD. [Double]
