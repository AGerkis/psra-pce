% uq_dummy_model.m
%
% Makes a 'dummy' PCE model for a given option set, consisting of all of
% the model properties and parameters, with a full coefficient set
% initialized to all ones. Intended for use cases where the model
% parameters (i.e. polynomial types and form) are needed, but the computed
% PCE model is not.
%
% Assumes that a user designed experiment is passed.
%
% Inputs: 
%   opt: The options with which to create the dummy model. [struct]
%
% Outputs:
%   dummy: The dummy model. [uq-model]
