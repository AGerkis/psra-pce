% dist_euclidean.m
%
% Computes the euclidean distance between two vectors in R^n.
%   d(x, y) = sqrt(sum(x(i) - y(i))^2)
%
% Inputs:
%   x: The first vector for the distance measurement. [N x 1]
%   y: The second vector for the distance measurement. [N x 1]
%
% Outputs:
%   d: The euclidean distance between x & y. [Double]
