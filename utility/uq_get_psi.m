% uq_get_psi.m
%
% Builds the regressor matrix for a PCE metamodel that has already been
% computed using UQ-Lab. Can compute the regressor matrix for a new sample set
% or for the experiment used to compute the metamodel coefficients.
%
% Inputs:
%   current_model: The PCE metamodel for which to build the regressor
%                  matrix. [uq-model]
%   X: The points on which to compute the regressor matrix. [N x M matrix] (OPTIONAL)
%
% Outputs:
%   Psi: The regressor matrix for the PCE, computed using the experiment. [N x P double]
%           N - Number of samples in experiment.
%           P - Size of basis.
