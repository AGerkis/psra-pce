% total_variation.m
%
% Computes the total variation between two datasets, A & B, as
%           TV(A, B) = 0.5*sum(|P(A) - P(B)|)
% where the probabilities are computed with a discretization of each given
% distribution into K bins.
%
% Inputs:
%   A: The first distribution. [N x 1 double]
%   B: The second distribution. [M x 1 double]
%   K: The number of bins to use for the discretization. [double] (OPTIONAL)
%
% Outputs:
%   tv: The total variation between the two distributions. [double]
