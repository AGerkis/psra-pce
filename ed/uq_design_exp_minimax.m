% uq_design_exp_minimax.m
%
% Designs N experiments through the minimax criteria. Generates N_cand
% candidate experiments and compute the maximum distance in each set.
% Selects the N experiments with the smallest maximum distances as the final
% output.
%
% Intended to be called from uq_design_exp and so does not support flexible
% input arguments. Assumes UQ-Lab was initialized at a higher level.
%
% Inputs:
%   in_model: The UQ-Lab formatted input model. [uq-input] (MANDATORY)
%   N: The number of points to include in each experiment. [Double] (MANDATORY)
%   N_exp: The number of experiments to generate. [Double] (MANDATORY)
%   Options: A structure containing various options pertaining to the
%            requested sampling method OR the method to use. [struct] (MANDATORY)
%
% Outputs:
%   exp: A tensor containing the requested experiments. [N x M x N_exp]
%        Third dimension elements correspond to different experiments.
